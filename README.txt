This project was released in an unfinished state, there will be bugs, and ugly and non-commented code,
it'll also be inconsistent in places, as some stuff haven't been updated
Some scripts are also in need of refactoring, as they will try to call outdated (and non-existant) code

Known issues:
Crashes the client randomly, seems to be more likely to happen if you run intensive tasks that
involves sending a lot of packets for prolonged periods
The cavebot's attack will sometimes not attack properly, seems to be a client bug, fixed by running a script

Would not have been possible without TibiaAPI, I learned a great deal from it
Also kudos to klusbert, DarkstaR, Jo3Bingham, Blequi, Farsa, beziak and possibly others
